# Archimedes AI

Archimedes is a RAG, which uses the capabilities of Claude Sonnet 3.5 to streamline the academic research process. Our solution leverages recent discoveries on the efficiency of LLMs in markdown processing, chain-of-thought prompting, and reranking to present a tool that could aid a researcher in easily getting access to knowledge in all available research papers, write literature reviews and generate paper ideas by easily pinpointing the gaps in the scholarly debate. 

Our backend code is available in the Python notebook in the repository.
